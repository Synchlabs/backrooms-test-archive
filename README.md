Welcome to the official Backrooms mod revival! In case you're interested in checking out the original, it can be found at

We're gearing up for a 0.1 release including a bunch of blocks and items from level 0. Sadly, worldgen and mobs are going to come at a later time, however still, they will be here soon.
