# Backrooms Mod

## Info

Welcome to the official Backrooms mod revival! In case you're interested in checking out the original, it can be found at
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-backrooms.

We're gearing up for a 0.1 release including a bunch of blocks and items from level 0. Sadly, worldgen and mobs are going to come at a later time, however still, they will be here soon.

However, if you're impatient and wanna try it out now, you can always download the mod files, import into your IDE of choice, and simply run 'gradlew build'. This will build your own fork of the mod!
